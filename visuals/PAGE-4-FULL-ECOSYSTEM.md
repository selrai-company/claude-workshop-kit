## The Three Types of Tools

### CLI Tools - Programs On Your Computer
Installed once, available forever. Claude uses them by typing commands.

```
git       → Downloads files and tracks changes
node      → Runs programs (Claude Code needs this)
python    → Runs scripts and automations
claude    → Starts your AI assistant
npm       → An app store for installing other tools
```

> Think of CLI tools like kitchen appliances - installed in your kitchen, ready to use anytime.

---

### MCP Tools - Live Connections to Your Apps
Claude gets login access to your apps. Can read, write, and act in real time.

```
Gmail MCP         → Reads your emails, searches inbox, drafts replies
Google Calendar   → Reads schedule, finds free time, creates events
Notion            → Reads and updates your workspace
Playwright        → Controls your browser (the most powerful one)
n8n               → Triggers your automation workflows
Slack             → Reads and sends messages
```

> Think of MCP tools like giving your assistant a key to each room in your office.

---

### Business APIs - Direct Lines to Services
Claude connects directly to services through their official programming interface.

```
Stripe API    → Check revenue, subscriptions, failed payments
GHL CRM API   → Manage contacts, send messages, update deals
Xero API      → Read invoices, expenses, financial statements
Meta Ads API  → Check campaign performance, update budgets
Any service   → If it has an API, Claude can connect to it
```

> Think of APIs like a phone line between your assistant and a service. Claude dials in and gets your data.

---

## What "Connecting" a Tool Means

```
1. Install the tool           →    npm install -g @googleworkspace/cli
2. Sign in                    →    gws auth login (browser opens, click "Allow")
3. Connection saved           →    Claude can now use Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and more
4. Permanent                  →    Works every session - no re-logging in
```

## What This All Makes Possible

```
TODAY - with what you have set up:
  → Research any topic in depth
  → Write copy, emails, social posts, proposals
  → Analyse competitors
  → Control your browser to do repetitive tasks
  → Build content calendars, strategies, plans

NEXT MONTH - with a few more connections:
  → Draft and search your emails
  → Build and schedule social media content
  → Monitor your pipeline and follow up leads
  → Generate weekly business reports automatically

IN 90 DAYS - with automation set up:
  → Leads identified and contacted without you touching it
  → Content posted to all platforms on schedule
  → Invoices scanned and filed automatically
  → Weekly summaries sent to your phone every Monday

LEVEL 4 - what Selr AI can build for you:
  → A full team of AI agents running your business
  → Each agent specialised in one area of your operations
  → You receive decisions, not task lists
  → You're managing a business, not doing admin
```

## Common Questions

**"Can Claude see all my private data?"**
Only what you give it access to. You control which tools connect. Nothing is accessed without your permission.

**"Is it safe? What if it does something I didn't want?"**
Claude asks before taking any significant action - sending emails, posting, deleting files. It confirms first.

**"Does connecting more tools cost more?"**
Most MCP connections are free. Business APIs (Stripe, GHL) have their own costs, but those exist whether you use AI or not.

**"What if I want to disconnect something?"**
Run `claude mcp remove [tool-name]` at any time.

**"I'm not technical - can I really do this?"**
You just did. You set it up today. The hard part is done.

## Getting Help After the Workshop

- **Full guide:** `docs/use/completion-guide.md` inside your kit folder
- **Skills reference:** `docs/skills/README.md` inside your kit folder
- Not sure where that is? Ask your assistant *"where is my kit installed?"* - it reads the path out of `~/.claude/selr-kit-manifest.json`
- **Selr AI:** selrai.com.au

> The best way to learn is to just try things. Ask Claude to do something for your business right now. You can't break anything that can't be fixed in 30 seconds.
